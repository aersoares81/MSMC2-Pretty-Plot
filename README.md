# MSMC2-Pretty-Plot
## R script to plot your MSMC2 results in an easy-to-read way

I wanted my MSMC2 plots to look nice, and maybe you want that too. This requires minimal edits to work. You will need to change `mu` and `gen` (mutation rate and generation time), and depending on your results you might want to remove/add some ticks. The code has a lot of comments, so it shouldn't be too hard to see where you can delete or add more ticks to your plot.

This was designed for plotting the results of a single individual, I might add other scripts for multiple individuals if there's demand or interest from the community.
