# MSMC2-Pretty-Plot
## R script to plot your MSMC2 results in an easy-to-read way

I wanted my MSMC2 plots to look nice, and maybe you want that too. This requires minimal edits to work. First you will need your MSMC2 results. You will also need to change `mu` and `gen` (mutation rate and generation time), and depending on your results you might want to adjust the y axis scale so your plot doesn't look "squished". The code has a lot of comments, so it shouldn't be too hard to see where you should edit things.

This was designed for plotting the results of a single individual, or the comparison of two results. I might add other scripts for multiple individuals if there's demand or interest from the community.

The example plots are for populations of the monkeyflower *Diplacus puniceus*.
